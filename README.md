# DCS-A-4E-C ExportScript
DCS Export-Scripts configuration for the community A-4E-C plane

This is a work in progress to specify a valid DCS Export-Scripts (https://github.com/s-d-a/DCS-ExportScripts) script for the Community Edition A-4E-C aircraft (https://github.com/heclak/community-a4e-c).

The purpose is so that Stream Deck with the DCS plugin can be used to control the aircraft. Export-Scripts has all official planes, but I could not find one for the A-4E-C.


/dev - contains sample files and scripts to pull debugging data and generate settings
/ExportModules - is the Export Script
